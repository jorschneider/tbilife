      <h1>About TBI Life</h1>

      <p>In December 2015, I slipped off a stage and landed directly on my forehead. What followed was a year-long journey through chronic pain, nausea, light and noise sensitivity, and cognitive challenges that fundamentally changed how I understood my brain and myself.</p>

      <p>I created this site to share what I learned during my recovery from post-concussion syndrome. My hope is that by documenting my experiences—the setbacks, the breakthroughs, the therapies that helped—I can help others going through similar struggles feel less alone and perhaps find some paths forward.</p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

      <p>This site contains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>My Story</strong> — A chronological account of my injury and recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Stories and Advice</strong> — Specific treatments, coping strategies, and recommendations that helped me</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Topics covered include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Buffalo Protocol for returning to cardio</li>
        <li>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback breathing</li>
        <li>Medication experiences (Sumatriptan)</li>
        <li>Physical therapy (Myoworx)</li>

        <li>Media recommendations (TV shows, podcasts) that won't trigger symptoms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Note</h2>

      <p>I'm not a doctor. Everything on this site is based on my personal experience. What worked for me may not work for you. Please consult with medical professionals about your own treatment.</p>

      <p>That said, I found that many of the most helpful things I discovered came from other patients sharing their experiences. I hope this site can be part of that community of knowledge.</p>

      <p>If you're struggling, know that you're not alone. Recovery is possible, even when it doesn't feel like it.</p>

      <p><strong>If you're in crisis, please call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or text HOME to 741741.</strong></p>
