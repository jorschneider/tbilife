      <h1>My Story Continued, Thoughts on Leadership</h1>
      <p class="article-date">September 2016</p>

      <p>I had it really good.</p>

      <p>I grew up in a stable, loving home. I was blessed to attend schools that embraced my love of learning. I found a passion in world politics and jobs to help me pursue it. And I had caring friends who welcomed my energetic, outgoing and unfiltered personality.</p>

      <p>Then, this past December, I fell six feet off a slippery stage onto my forehead. I got up fast but remember thinking, "This is what NFL players must feel like when they're hurt but don't want coach to take them out."</p>

      <p>Initially, I couldn't process that my brain wasn't the same. I had constant headaches and nausea. I grew uncharacteristically irritable and withdrawn. Even more distressing, I was unable to think in complicated sentences or mentally play out multiple scenarios without triggering pain.</p>

      <p><strong>Losing my intellectual agency was at first incomprehensible, and later incredibly demoralizing.</strong></p>

      <p>For the first six months, I had a hard time respecting my disability and the healing process. Hearing mixed messages from neurologists (some advising rest, others continuing life as usual), I followed the path of least resistance. While on medical leave, I still read, dated, lifted weights and hosted presidential debate-watching parties, often through excruciating pain. I was scared to admit to myself or anyone else just how sick I was.</p>

      <p>This strategy created a vicious cycle. Trying my best to be my usual self, the pain would only crescendo, ultimately forcing me back into dark rooms.</p>

      <h2>A New Approach</h2>

      <p>After the third setback, I needed a new approach. I adopted a strategy of cutting out and then slowly increasing cognitive, social, and physical exertion. I had to replace the things I loved with a set of hobbies more comfortable in a nursing home than a dance hall. I couldn't go straight back to my former life. But if I transformed my routines—and, critically, found fulfillment and joy in them—I could trudge inch by inch towards recovery.</p>

      <p>I knew I didn't have the willpower to break out of my cycle alone. So, I wrote to my friends about my struggles and asked for help. I also zeroed in on three new hobbies that could give me a sense of progression—drawing, cooking, and meditation—as well as a regimen of cardio, posture, and eye exercises.</p>

      <p>I hoped that by sharing my progress week to week, I would not just motivate myself to live up to my regimen but inspire my friends to install more positive habits as well. I created an account on Habitica, an activity tracker app with an RPG overlay, and invited friends and family to my guild.</p>

      <h2>The Power of Transparency</h2>

      <p>I started sending weekly emails to my friends detailing my progress. I reveled in my successes ("Just listened to two songs in a row without my head exploding!"), and I honestly admitted my failings ("Watched too much Olympics and sped up my audiobook to 2x...and just fell back to where I was a month ago"). Forcing myself to reflect each week gave me a sense of improvement I didn't know I had made and helped me realize what was and wasn't working.</p>

      <p>The longer I kept this up, the more I realized the weekly updates weren't impacting just me but my friends as well. One by one I received incredible emails like, "Jordan I know you feel like you've changed so much as a person, but two things I love about you—your enthusiasm to try new things and eagerness to bring different people together—are still very much present."</p>

      <p>Most powerfully, one friend opened up about his suicidal thoughts, concluding his message by saying, <strong>"If you're trying, I can follow suit."</strong></p>

      <p>Only after I started receiving these emails did I recognize the power of my example. Once I got past my denial, I was able to embrace transparency and harness its power. What my openness did for my friends inspired me to start this website.</p>

      <p>By setting an example, warts and all, I was able to encourage others to live up to it. Through this recovery process, I have developed a leadership style that I will always carry with me: <strong>to live honestly and openly.</strong></p>

      <p>No doubt, it has been a rocky and painful year. But in this year I have learned a tremendous amount about myself and my capabilities. I've uncovered reserves of ingenuity, resilience, determination and empathy I frankly didn't know were there. I am now more confident than ever in my ability to do something meaningful with my life.</p>
